                        Our team will start implementing breeding functions in
                        the upcoming weeks after the launch, which will allow
                        Fat Apes holders to receive tokens and burn them to
                        create new, stronger apes. In order to benefit from
                        these breeding functions, you must own at least 2 Fat
                        Apes.
